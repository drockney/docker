# AsciiBinder

This implementation of [Red Hat's AsciiBinder project](https://github.com/redhataccess/ascii_binder) 
was built using [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) instead of the CentOS 7 Ruby image.

See the [AsciiBinder GitHub page](https://github.com/redhataccess/ascii_binder) for more 
information on how to use AsciiBinder.
